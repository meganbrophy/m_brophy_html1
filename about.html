			<h1>Location and Ambiance</h1>
			<p>Set in a prime spot at the Victoria Wharf, Baía (pronounced Ba-hia and meaning the Bay) enjoys spectacular panoramic harbour and ocean views. It has a cocktail bar, interior dining areas and covered outside dining areas spread across four terraces. The relaxing interior refl ects the beauty of Table Bay in the wave-like mosaics and pale blues and mauve colours.</p>
			<p>The Victoria and Alfred Waterfront is one of Africa’s most visited destinations and attracts 24 million people every year. Its setting, in the oldest working harbour in the southern hemisphere, is simply spectacular: it has Table Mountain as a dramatic backdrop as well as extensive views of the ocean,city bowl and the mountain peaks of the Hottentots-Holland Mountains.</p>
